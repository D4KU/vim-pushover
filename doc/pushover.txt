DESCRIPTION                          *pushover*

This |plugin| provides an interface to easily create |mapping|s to push around
|text-objects|. Pushing can be understood as deleting the |text-object| under the
cursor, making a |motion|, and pasting it again.

This plugin depends on the |vim-exchange| plugin.
https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-exchange

To make the created |mapping|s repeatable, |vim-repeat| must be installed.

MAPPINGS                             *pushover-mappings*

                                     *<w*
<w           Move the |word| under the cursor [count] |words| to the left

                                     *>w*
>w           Move the |word| under the cursor [count] |words| to the right

                                     *<W*
<W           Move the |WORD| under the cursor [count] |WORDS| to the left

                                     *>W*
>W           Move the |WORD| under the cursor [count] |WORDS| to the right

                                     *<p*
<p           Move the paragraph under the cursor [count] paragraphs up

                                     *>p*
>p           Move the paragraph under the cursor [count] paragraphs down

CUSTOMIZING                          *pushover-customizing*

*g:pushover_forward_prefix* (default `>`)

String prefix used for the left-hand-side of the created forward mappings.

*g:pushover_backward_prefix* (default `<`)

String prefix used for the left-hand-side of the created backward mappings.

*g:pushover_maps*

Each entry in this |dictionary| is translated into two <Plug> |mapping| of the
form `<Plug>Pushover_[prefix][key]`, one for the forward and one for the
backward |motion|.

Its keys specify the name of the |mapping|s, without the prefix.
Its values are three-element-lists with the following strings as elements:
  1. |text-object| to remove and paste elsewhere
  2. |motion| to move forward to the paste location
  3. |motion| to move backward to the paste location

By default, it is defined as:
>
  let g:pushover_maps =
      \ {
      \   'w': ['iw', 'w', 'b'],
      \   'W': ['iW', 'W', 'B'],
      \   'p': ['ip', '}j', '{k']
      \ }
<

If these |text-objects| and |motion|s have been remapped themselves,
|vim-pushover| respects that.

*g:pushover_map_plugs* (default `true`)

If this |variable| is `true`, the <Plug> |mapping| created from |g:pushover_maps|
is mapped to its `prefix` + `key`. Set it to `false`, if you wish to create
the mappings yourself, for example if they are conflicting with other plugins.
